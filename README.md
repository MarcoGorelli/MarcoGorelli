Hello everybody,

I work on pandas (as part of work) and polars (as volunteer), and am mostly interested in time series.

I've also written some code quality tools:
- cython-lint
- absolufy-imports (superseded by ruff)
- nbQA (probably soon-to-be superseded by ruff)
- auto-walrus (very silly, not recommended, hopefully won't be implemented in ruff)
